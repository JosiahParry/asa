# Advanced Spatial Analysis
# Reading Responses

The reading response prompts appear in each module's readme.md file. To submit your reading response:

  1. fork the course repo to your GitHub account, then clone it to your local machine (if you haven't already)
  1. inside the current module's reading response folder (for example, `readings/responses/module01`), create a new file called `lastname-firstname-module##-response.md`. For example, during module 01 I would create a file called `boeing-geoff-module01-response.md`. See [example](module01/boeing-geoff-module01-response.md).
  1. write your reading response in markdown in this file: feel free to use formatting like bold and italics, links, and images when useful.
  1. when you're done, save your file, `git add` it, `git commit` it, `git push` it, then submit a pull request. *Make sure there is nothing else in this pull request except for your one reading response file (do not add/commit any other changes to the repo)*.

I will merge all reading response pull requests at the due date/time. Anything submitted after this will be late.
